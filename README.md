#### Hi, there! Welcome to my Github profile ðŸšŽ ðŸŒ¸ ðŸª´

My name is Shelby Green. I'm a researcher and civic technologist. 

I like to explore landscapes and history; make digital maps; program; and socialize.

<b>what am i working on?</b>
<br>
- tracking how utilities dominate the political landscape to evade social responsibility and climate accountability, with [EPI](https://energyandpolicy.org/)
- developing interactive environmental resource inventories, with [Leon's Soil and Water Conservation District](https://twitter.com/leon_swcd)
- openly communicating public data, with [opentlh](https://twitter.com/opentlh)
- encouraging social interactions in physical and digital civic spaces as a community organizer
- building modular data and software solutions with [together, not for.](https://togethernotfor.com/)

<br>

<b>what am i building?</b>
- a twitter/IG bot that makes daily posts about local black history

<br>

<b>what am i learning/thinking about?</b>
- how to encourage the conversion of anger into action
- how to regulate public utilities
